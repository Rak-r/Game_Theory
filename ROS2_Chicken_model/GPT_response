Given that the robot's velocities may change within each segment, and you have specific velocity limits, you can incorporate these into a more accurate time calculation. This means you need to account for the changing velocities within each segment to estimate the time to collision or the closest waypoint accurately.

Here's an updated version of the function that considers variable velocities within segments:

1. **Use a finer discretization of each segment**: This approach assumes the velocity can change within the segment, and it divides each segment into smaller sub-segments to account for this change.

2. **Calculate time for each sub-segment**: Sum these times to get the total time for the segment.

Here is the revised function:

```python
import numpy as np

def find_time_to_closest_waypoint_and_collision(self, m, c, robot_velocities, velocity_limit=0.2):
    min_time_to_closest_waypoint = float('inf')
    min_time_to_collision = float('inf')
    total_time_elapsed = 0.0

    for i in range(len(self.waypoints) - 1):
        x0, y0 = self.waypoints[i]  # start points of the segment
        x1, y1 = self.waypoints[i + 1]  # end points of the segment

        segment_vector = self.waypoints[i + 1] - self.waypoints[i]
        segment_length = np.linalg.norm(segment_vector)

        # Estimate the time to traverse the segment using average velocity if velocities are changing
        start_velocity = robot_velocities[i]
        end_velocity = robot_velocities[i + 1]
        average_velocity = (start_velocity + end_velocity) / 2.0
        average_velocity = np.clip(average_velocity, -velocity_limit, velocity_limit)
        segment_time = segment_length / average_velocity if average_velocity != 0 else float('inf')

        denominator = m * (x1 - x0) - (y1 - y0)
        if denominator != 0:
            t = (y0 - m * x0 - c) / denominator
            if 0.0 <= t <= 1.0:
                # Find the intersection point
                intersection = np.array([x0 + t * (x1 - x0), y0 + t * (y1 - y0)])

                # Calculate the time at which the robot reaches the intersection point
                time_at_intersection = total_time_elapsed + t * segment_time

                # Update the minimum time to collision point
                if time_at_intersection < min_time_to_collision:
                    min_time_to_collision = time_at_intersection

        # Update total elapsed time
        total_time_elapsed += segment_time

        # Update the minimum time to closest waypoint
        if total_time_elapsed < min_time_to_closest_waypoint:
            min_time_to_closest_waypoint = total_time_elapsed

    return min_time_to_closest_waypoint, min_time_to_collision
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_time_to_closest_waypoint` and `min_time_to_collision` are initialized to `inf` to ensure any calculated time will be less and will update these variables.
   - `total_time_elapsed` is initialized to 0 to track the cumulative time as the robot progresses through its waypoints.

2. **Loop Through Segments**:
   - For each segment (from waypoint `i` to `i+1`), the segment vector, length, and average velocity are calculated.
   - The average velocity is computed from the start and end velocities of the segment and clipped to the specified velocity limits.
   - `segment_time` is calculated as the length of the segment divided by the average velocity. If the average velocity is zero, `segment_time` is set to infinity to avoid division by zero.

3. **Intersection Calculation**:
   - The parameter `t` is calculated to determine where the pedestrian's trajectory intersects the robot's path segment.
   - If `0 <= t <= 1`, the intersection point is within the segment.
   - `time_at_intersection` is the cumulative time elapsed plus the time to reach the intersection point within the segment.

4. **Update Minimum Times**:
   - `min_time_to_collision` is updated if `time_at_intersection` is the earliest collision time found.
   - `min_time_to_closest_waypoint` is updated to the cumulative time elapsed at each waypoint.

5. **Return**:
   - The function returns the minimum times to the closest waypoint and the collision point.

### Notes:
- This function accounts for varying velocities within each segment by using the average velocity for the segment.
- If you need even more accuracy, you could further discretize each segment into smaller sub-segments and apply a similar approach to account for finer variations in velocity.
